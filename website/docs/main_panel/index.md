# Overview

## Animate
- Animate Position: Animate object/bone's position based off given stroke path
- Animate Rotation: Animate object/bone's rotation based off given stroke path

## Target
- Target: Behaviour to set the target list
- Target Enum: List of affected objects or bones

## Settings
- Position Orientation: Whether to move based off global or local axis
- Rotation Orientation: Whether to rotate based off global or local axis
- Rotation Center: Origin used to calculate the rotation of a stroke

---

- Conversion Method: Whether to use whole points, or the intersection only
- Timing: Can be set to be either each individual points/intersection, or set duration
- Total Duration: Total frames will not exceed this number. Only appear if `Timing` is set to `Duration`
- Frame Step: Skip every this many frame

---

- Interpolation: Interpolation type that will be used for keyframes

---

- Relative to Stroke: When enabled, `Animate Position` position will be relative to its current position and the stroke path
- Initial Rotation: When enabled, both `Animate Position` and `Animate Rotation` will account the object/bone initial rotation before applying the rotation
- Rotate Along Path: When enabled, `Animate Position` will rotate the object along the path
- Reverse Path: When enabled, script will reverse the order of the points
- Delete After: When enabled, annotation/grease pencil active frame or curve object will be deleted after using `Animate Position` or `Animate Rotation`

---

- Movement Axis: Defines which axis will affect `Animate Position`
- Rotation Axis: Defines which axis will affect `Animate Position` (if `Rotate Along Path` is enabled) or `Animate Rotation`

### Track Settings
- Only Rotate Up: When enabled, `Animate Position` will only rotate the up axis only. `Rotation Axis` will be suppressed
- Determine Axis Automatically: When enabled, track axis and up axis will be determined automatically
- Track/Forward Axis: Forward axis. Disabled if `Determine Axis Automatically` is enabled
- Up Axis: Up axis. Disabled if `Determine Axis Automatically` is enabled

### Position Offset
Property to offset the position when animating the position. Only works for `Animate Position`.

### Rotation Offset
Property to offset the rotation when animating the position. Works for both `Animate Position` (if `Rotate Along Path` is enabled) and `Animate Rotation`.

### Flip Detection
- Smooth Flips: When enabled, script will attempt to negate rotation that is greater than the flip threshold. Only works for `Animate Position` while `Rotate Along Path` is enabled
- Map to Zero: When enabled, flips will not be greater than 360Â° and is instead set to 0. Only works for Euler and if `Smooth Flips` is enabled
- Flip Threshold: Angle to define flips. If angle difference is greater than this, then proceed to negate this rotation
