title: Animate Position
---

!!! info "Info"
    Stroke mentioned in this page depends on the stroke detection on [`Source Stroke`](../stroke_panel/index.md#source-stroke)

## Animate Position
Animate object/bone position based off given stroke path. You can also [draw interection line to fine tune your timing](../other/timing_chart.md).

## Rotating Along Path
By enabling [`Rotate Along Path`](#rotate-along-path), you can make the object to rotate along the path in a similar manner with [`Follow Path` object constraint](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/constraints/relationship/follow_path.htm#bpy-types-followpathconstraint) with `Follow Curve` enabled.

!!! warning "Rotation Types"
    It is recommended to use Quaternion or Euler rotation type. Any other rotation type than Quaternion or Euler will throw error.

## Settings
### Position Orientation
When set to global, target position will move across global axis, while local will just copy local translation into the object.

### Relative to Stroke
When enabled, object position will be relative to its current position with the stroke path.

### Rotate Along Path
When enabled, each point will have rotation that is generated by using 2/3 vector (tangent, right, up) [by using code from this forum](https://blenderartists.org/t/trying-to-simulate-follow-path-constraint-using-just-python/1142440). These rotation will correspond to the path.

!!! example "Inaccuracy"
    Rotation generated using this script does not yield same result with the constraint. Even though they appear visually correct, the errors can be seen when the frames are interpolated (eg, using frame step that is higher than 1), [which this script attempt to fix it by negating the rotation](#flip-detection) (assuming flip detection is enabled). However, the negation had worse result for Euler.

### Movement Axis
Used to include/exclude certain axis from being moved.

### Position Offset
Position applied prior to final transformation. Useful when using [`surface`](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/annotate_tool.html#bpy-types-toolsettings-annotation-stroke-placement-view3d) placement so that the object will not clip through the surface.

## Tracking
When [`Rotate Along Path`](#rotate-along-path) is enabled, these settings become relevant

### Track Settings
#### Rotation Axis
Used to include/exclude certain axis from being rotated.

#### Only Rotate Up
When enabled, object will only rotate axis correspond to world up axis. Which supposedly result much cleaner or smoother rotation compared when using all axes.

#### Track/Forward Axis and Up Axis
If `Determine Axis Automatically` is enabled, then track and up axis will be determined automatically depending on the stroke path position. Otherwise, you can manually set the axis, which can be used if you want to achieve specific rotation direction. Also, when using automatic, previously used axis will be displayed within the panel.

#### Rotation Offset
This setting is used for tracking only, as it is redundant for [`Animate Rotation`](./animate_rotation.md).

By default, `Auto Fix Rotation` is enabled, which has pre-determined values to properly fix rotation. You can manually set rotation to offset the rotation prior to final transformation.

#### Flip Detection
As previously said from [`Rotate Along Path`](#rotate-along-path), this panel allows to disable such feature. When `Smooth Flips` is enabled, if the rotation angle between previous rotation and current rotation is greater than the value set on `Flip Threshold`, then the rotation will be negated.

`Map to Zero` is made for euler to prevent rotation going over 360Â°, if rotation doesn't looked right, this boolean can be disabled.
