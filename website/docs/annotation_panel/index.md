# Overview
![annotation_panel](../images/annotation_panel.png)

If annotation data exist, this panel will show layer operations for convenience.

`Insert Blank Keyframe` is operator to add blank keyframe on current frame, this is useful to reduce clutter in scene (aside from hiding the layer). When `Only Active Layer` is enabled, then only the currently active layer will be affected, otherwise all other layer wil be affected.
