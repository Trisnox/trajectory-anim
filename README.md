# Trajectory Anim
Blender add-on to quickly animate by drawing trajectory line.

Similar to `Follow Path` constraints, you can animate an object by drawing a trajectory line, but much more convenient and faster than using the constraints. Aside from following and/or rotating along the path, you can also draw trajectory line to represent rotation. Not only that, but you can also draw intersection line in your trajectory line to represent [timing chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZQ4GCdiCuM), which give better control over timing/easing.
